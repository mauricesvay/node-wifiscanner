# node WiFiScanner

## Installing

    npm install node-wifiscanner

## About

Scan surrounding WiFi access points with NodeJS.

On Mac, it will use the `airport` command.  
On Linux, it will use the `iwlist` command (may require root privileges).
On Windows, it will use the `netsh` command.

How to use :

	// scanner.js

	var wifiscanner = require('node-wifiscanner');

	wifiscanner.scan(function(err, data){
		if (err) {
			console.log("Error : " + err);
			return;
		}

		console.log(data);
	});

Scanning surrounding WiFi access points is useful for getting geolocation. See `geolocation.js` for an example.
